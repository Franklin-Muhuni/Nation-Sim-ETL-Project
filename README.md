# Nation-Sim ETL Project
### Background & Objective
This project was built to illustrate a basic implementation of **E**xtract-**L**oad-**T**ransform (ETL) using data taken from the [politics & war game](https://politicsandwar.com/), with the end goal of using the data gathered to create analyses and generate visualizations. Having played this game for quite a while, I was particularly interested in extracting key metrics regarding the state of the in-game world. Wanting to stray from already existing avenues provided by the game or the community, I decided to gradually build my own as practice for future projects with these technologies.
### Data Sources
All the data I need for now comes from the V3 GraphQL API. Important resources for locating and testing endpoints can be found on the pnwkit-py repository and [documentation](https://docs.pnwkit-py.mrvillage.dev/en/latest/index.html) as well the [API playground](https://api.politicsandwar.com/graphql-playground).
